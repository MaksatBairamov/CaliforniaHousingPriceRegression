# California Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
The "California Housing Price Prediction" project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at predicting housing prices in California. Utilizing the California Housing dataset, this project implements various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LASSO to achieve accurate predictions. The project encompasses a full pipeline from data preprocessing to visualization, providing a robust approach to understanding and predicting housing prices.

## Project Structure
- `data_preprocessing.py`: This script is responsible for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the housing dataset for analysis. It ensures the data is in the appropriate format for model training.
- `model_training.py`: This file contains the implementation of various machine learning models. It includes the setup, training, and evaluation of models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LASSO.
- `visualization.py`: This script focuses on visualizing the data and results of the model predictions. It generates plots and charts that aid in interpreting the data and assessing model performance.
- `main.py`: The main entry point of the project. It orchestrates the workflow of data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
